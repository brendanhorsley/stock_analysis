# Analysis of Green Stocks in 2017 and 2018

## Overview of the Project
  The purpose of this project was to analyze stock data for the client Steve.
  His parents were interested in investing into a green energy stock such as DQ since they met at Dairy Queen.
  However, Steve desired a more thorough analysis to help guide his parents.
  This project anaylzed stock data from 2017 and 2018 on green energy stocks.
  The analysis was then refactored to improve the time and memory needed to complete the analysis for the client.

## Results

### 2017

In 2017 we can see DQ managed to yield the largest return of the 12 stocks analyzed.
DQ also had the lowest volume.
Overall most of the stocks in 2017 had good returns.
The stock with the ticker "TERP" was the only stock that lost money in 2017.
